load the Durin data set

filter to DroughtNet

checking for multiple heights in Calluna vulgaris specifically Lygra

      ungroup()
    view(multiple_heights_calluna)

    expanded_calluna <- multiple_heights_calluna %>% #expanded the envelope_ID collumn to display all the barcodes
      unnest(envelope_ids)
    view(expanded_calluna)
    # a good number of the plants with multiple heights
    # solution plot 1.2, plant 1, 6 envelopes same height, the BOA from phys had NA, plant 2, 6 envelopes same height, the 7 the one, BNS from phys, 3.3 6 envelopes same height, the 7th BOJ2452- phys
    ```

checking calluna short or long shoot type
```{r}
# Get unique values of calluna_shoot_type for "Calluna vulgaris" in "Lygra"
unique_values <- droughtnet_data %>%
  filter(species == "Calluna vulgaris", siteID == "Lygra") %>%
  pull(calluna_shoot_type) %>%
  unique()

print(unique_values)
# tried all ways i could think of to filter missing shoot type rows, but all the codes retains the rows with a mix of both
#only this gave me NA ??????
```
