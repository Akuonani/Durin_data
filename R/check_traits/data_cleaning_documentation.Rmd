We resolved any errors found by determining the most likely mistake and correcting typos in reproducible code (see GitHub repo). We cross-referenced data entry between the unique plot identifier (DURIN) or plot designations (DroughtNet) and site, habitat, treatments, and species. As of 2023.10.25, we have not verified this in DroughtNet, although we have corrected plot numbering in Tjøtta. Plant height was cross-referenced to separate field data sheets. We also verified that the correct number of plants were collected within each plot. When plants with only young leaves (C. vulgaris, V. myrtillus) were assigned ‘old’ leaf ages, we verified their species assignment before reassigning their leaf age to ‘young.’  Where the number of leaves in a bulk sample (E. nigrum or C. vulgaris) was missing, we assigned the number of leaves counted in the leaf area scan. For all other leaf counts, we verified that the entered number of leaves matched the number counted in the scan. Those that did not match were visually checked to determine if the wrong leaf was matched to a record (e.g., wrong species n = 3) or if the scan needed additional cleaning (n = XX). We checked unrealistically high or low values for all traits (mean one order of magnitude off; except plant height greater than 5 * mean). We also compared wet mass to dry mass and SLA to leaf area to identify outliers. Each outlier was verified for data entry and if it remained an unlikely value, we reweighed the dry mass. Where we couldn’t resolve a data entry issue or a biologically impossible value, we flagged the data entry line as ‘orphan’ or ‘duplicate’ as appropriate and dropped it from our analyses (‘duplicate’ n = 2, ‘orphan’ n = 11). If the data issue only affected one trait (e.g., wet mass), we replaced that value with NA.
